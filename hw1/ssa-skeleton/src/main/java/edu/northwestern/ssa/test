View Sign Obituary Send Flowers Cullen, Terrence Patrick "Terry" ALBANY Terrence Patrick Cullen "Terry" died peacefully in his sleep on August 26, 2019, after an extended illness. He was predeceased by his parents Edward and Elizabeth (Betty Powers); and his brother Michael. He is survived by his brothers, Joseph (Sherre) of Evanston, Ill., William (Roxanne) of Penfield, N.Y., and David (Vicky) of Horseheads, N.Y.; and his sister-in-law Jean Cullen of Elmira, N.Y. He was the beloved uncle of Adam, Brian (Kate), Ethan, Matthew, Jaimi, and Lindsey. He adored his great-nephew Graham. Terry is also survived by his former partner David Shetler; lifelong friends, Joseph Egnaczak and Michael McCann, and very close friends, Peter Mesh, Peter Slattery, Ron Gleason and Bill Capone; his goddaughter Marielle Celeste Brown and her mother Lisa Brown; and many dear friends. Terry was born in Elmira, N.Y. on April 6, 1955. He graduated from Thomas A. Edison High School in Elmira Heights, N.Y. in 1973. He was on the swim team and remained an avid swimmer his whole life. Terry competed in the Gay Games in Vancouver in 1990. Terry attended Corning Community College and the State University of New York at Alfred where he obtained a degree in nursing. He later went on to earn an M.P.A. from Syracuse University. Terry worked for the State of New York for nearly 40 years, first as a nurse and then in the Budget Department, where he retired as the deputy director of medicaid finance. Terry loved to travel and enjoyed his many adventures with family and friends, especially his trips abroad, to any beach anywhere, and to Wanakena in the beautiful Adirondacks. Terry played on the volleyball league in Syracuse for many years and continued to play after moving to Albany. He was also active in a tennis league in Albany, and he continued to play tennis, swim, and even learned to play pickle ball the last year of his life. Terry volunteered as a teen mentor for many years. After retiring, Terry volunteered at Albany Medical Center and Parsons Child & Family Center because he found great joy when working with children. Terry will be remembered for his kind heart, his thoughtful nature, and his gentle spirit. Terry was beloved by many. This was made clear by the outpouring of support shown by so many friends who helped him navigate his challenging final years. What a blessing and what a gift to him! A memorial service will be planned for a future date. In lieu of flowers, please consider making a gift to support Alzheimer's research, with the hope that fewer people will have to live with this dreadful disease.

No. 582 + B A R T H O L O M E W By God’s Mercy Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch To All the Plenitude of the Church Grace, Peace and Mercy from the Maker of All Creation Our Lord, God and Savior Jesus Christ Dearest brother Hierarchs and beloved children in the Lord, With the goodness and grace of the all-bountiful God, today marks the 30th anniversary since the Holy Great Church of Christ established the feast of Indiction and first day of the ecclesiastical year as “the day of environmental protection.” We did not only address our Orthodox faithful, nor again just Christian believer or even representatives of other religions, but also political leaders, environmentalists and other scientists, as well as intellectuals and all people of good will, seeking their contribution. The ecological activities of the Ecumenical Patriarchate served as the inspiration for theology to advance prominently the truth of Christian anthropology and cosmology, the Eucharistic worldview and treatment of creation, along with the spirit of Orthodox asceticism as the basis for understanding the reason for and response to the ecological crisis. The bibliography related to theological ecology or ecological theology is extensive and on the whole constitutes an admirable Orthodox witness before the major challenges of contemporary humanity and earthly life. Concern for the ecological crisis and for the global dimensions and consequences of sin – of this alienating internal “reversal of values” in humankind – brought to the surface the connection between ecological and social issues as well as for the need to address them jointly. Mobilizing forces for the protection of the integrity of creation and for social justice are interconnected and inseparable actions. The interest of the Ecumenical Patriarchate for the protection of creation did not arise as a reaction to or as a result of the contemporary ecological crisis. The latter was simply the motivation and occasion for the Church to express, develop, proclaim and promote its environmentally-friendly principles. The foundation of the Church’s undiminished concern for the natural environment lies in its ecclesiological identity and theology. Respect and care for creation are a dimension of our faith, the content of our life in the Church and as the Church. The very life of the Church is “an experienced ecology,” an applied respect and care for creation, and the source of its environmental activities. In essence, the interest of the Church for the protection of the environment is the extension of the Holy Eucharist in all dimensions of its relationship to the world. The liturgical life of the Church, the ascetic ethos, pastoral service and experience of the cross and resurrection by the faithful, the unquenchable desire for eternity: all of these comprise a communion of persons for which the natural reality cannot be reduced to an object or useful matter to meet the needs of an individual or humanity; by contrast, this reality is considered as an act, deed the handiwork of a personal God, who calls us to respect and protect it, thereby rendering us His “coworkers,” “stewards,” “guardians,” and “priests” of creation in order to cultivate a Eucharistic relationship with it. Care for the natural environment is not an added activity, but an essential expression of church life. It does not have a secular, but rather a purely ecclesiastical character. It is a “liturgical ministry.” All of the initiatives and activities of the Church are “applied ecclesiology.” In this sense, theological ecology does not merely refer to the development of an ecological awareness or the response to ecological problems on the basis of the principles of Christian anthropology and cosmology. On the contrary, it involves the renewal of the whole creation in Christ, just as this is realized and experienced in the Holy Eucharist, which is an image and foretaste of the eschatological fullness of the Divine Economy in the doxological wholeness and luminous splendor of the heavenly kingdom. Most honorable brothers and most precious children in the Lord, The ecological crisis reveals that our world comprises an integral whole, that our problems are global and shared. In order to meet these challenges, we require a multilayered mobilization, a common accord, direction and action. It is inconceivable for humankind to recognize the severity of the problem and yet continue to behave in oblivion. While in recent decades the dominant model of economic development in the context of globalization – highlighting the fetishism of financial markers and magnification of financial profit – has exacerbated ecological and economic problems, the notion still prevails widely that “there is no other alternative” and that not conforming to the rigid validity logic of the world’s economy will lead to unbridled social and financial situations. Thus, any alternative forms of development, along with the power of social solidarity and justice, are overlooked and undermined. For our part, however, we are obliged to assume greater measures for the application of the ecological and social consequences of our faith. It is extremely vital that our archdioceses and metropolises, as well as many of our parishes and sacred monasteries, have fostered initiatives and activities for the protection of the environment, but also various programs of ecological education. We should pay special attention to the Christian formation of our youth, so that it may function as an area of cultivation and development of an ecological ethos and solidarity. Childhood and adolescence are particularly susceptible life phases for ecological and social responsiveness. Aware of the urgency of environmental education, the Ecumenical Patriarchate devoted the Third in its series of international Halki Summits to the subject of “Theological Education and Ecological Awareness” (Istanbul, May 31st to June 4th, 2019) with a view to incorporating ecology and environmental awareness into programs and curricula of theological schools and seminaries. The solution to the great challenges of our world is unattainable without spiritual orientation. In conclusion, then, we wish all of you a favorable and blessed ecclesiastical year, filled with works pleasing to God. We invite the radiant children of the Mother Church throughout the world to pray for the integrity of creation, to be sustainable and charitable in every aspect of their lives, to strive for the protection of the natural environment, as well as the promotion of peace and justice. And we proclaim once more the truth that there can be no genuine progress, when the “very good” creation and the human person made in the image and likeness of God suffer. Finally, through the intercession of the first-among-the-saints Theotokos Pammakaristos, we invoke upon you the life-giving grace and boundless mercy of the Creator and Provider of all.

No. 3: Brotherhood of St. Symeon the New Theologian, Miramar, FL The “Historic Church” is always an “imperfect Church,” despite her inherent sanctity. Every student of Church History knows it but well. The “Golden Age” of the Church – the age of Chrysostom and the Cappadocians – was an age of schisms, rifts, treason and suspicions. Did not St. Gregory of Nazianzus suggest that apparently Christ was asleep on the boat tossed by storms? Did not St. Basil describe the story of his time as that of an eclipse, when it was almost impossible in the darkness – to tell foes from friends? Was not St. John Chrysostom betrayed by his fellow-bishops and was to die as a “bloodless martyr”? And yet, it was, no doubt, a golden age! On the other hand, Christian preaching had always been an offense, already in the times of St. Paul. Yet, St. Paul did not think that it was permissible to “adjust” his preaching to the “capacity” of those to whom it had to be addressed. He did not hesitate “to offend” them. Why should we, in our own time, be shy at this point, and be so concerned with the “changing times”? There is no crisis of traditional theology, but there is a profound crisis of belief, of faith. Those, who are unable and unwilling to believe with the Church, still want to be counted as Christians. Then they face an alternative: disregard all that they do not find valid (what the majority of the actual membership in our Church is doing, without “theology”, dogmas, etc.) or call for a formal retraction of what they perceive as “traditional”, “obsolete”, “ancient”, “Hellenic.” They have lost faith, and for that reason, they feel that they need to change theology. Indeed, bad or negligent teaching in our Church has been responsible for that defection or ignorance. I mean, the teaching might have been deficient, but true theology is, nevertheless, true and valid. Reinterpretation may be needed, but not an adjustment. Let those who are still feeling with the Church (sentire cum ecclesia), thank God for His help and blessing, because faith is somehow always a gift of God, in Spiritu Sancto. What we are missing now is a theology well-presented. Unfortunately, one begins very often not with “the Faith as once delivered unto the Saints,” but with the alleged “Modern Mind,” which is, in fact, still in flux. A Protestant friend of mine rightly suggested that the “Modern Man” has not yet made up his mind. Rather, he is simply a person with modern moods and whims.

Similar phrases were also in the letter of Archbishop Anastasius, primate of the Albanian Church, and in the letter of the Synod of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus. But they do not concern the recognition of the Church itself,” Fr. Nikolai explained. The Greek Church understands what is schism and what isn’t, Fr. Nikolai said. However, they are under pressure and want to avoid a direct confrontation with Constantinople. “But they cannot change the truth and say that what is obviously wrong is right; they cannot call black white.” Vladimir Legoida, the head of the Moscow Patriarchate’s Synodal Department for Relations with Society and the Media, also spoke of the pressure on the Greek Church: “How the Greek Church discusses the question of the schismatic OCU demonstrates the unprecedented severity of the problem and also of the pressure that is being exerted.” The Greek Church offered Constantinople “a spoonful of honey” with its statement about the Patriarchate’s right to grant autocephaly, though at the same time, the statement is balanced and generally well received, Fr. Nikolai noted. “We understand the whole situation the Greek Church has found itself in, and we see that it does not want to be responsible for the splitting of the Orthodox world. Because any other Church that joins this decision of Constantinople, will be the first, in fact, in the division of the Orthodox world into two parts: Those who will recognize the OCU, and those who will not,” the speaker said. He also noted that there are no analogous situations in Church history in which a minority schismatic group was granted autocephaly and raised above the group that all Churches recognized as canonical. “The Russian Orthodox Church has always testified that the most important factor in this discussion should be concern for the Orthodox Ukrainians, the children of the canonical Church, who as a result of the Phanar’s intervention became a majority persecuted by the radicals,” Legoida also wrote. “Any support for the OCU by the Local Churches can only lead to further division in Ukrainian society, the deepening of the schism, and the escalation of hatred,” the Russian Church representative said.

The press release concerning the results of the meeting was posted today (Saturday). https://www.facebook.com/ecumenicalpatriarchate/?__tn__=kCH-R&eid=ARCT1A3O6dAskvFf0ErJbFzhmpS-zkbxs6v_KkfWrsdlDqjDVGWmFku5vJ8J-roM5_ttDWTqYUX0B0vx&hc_ref=ARTsNzwPjolkEHRPNLm-QSwZq98tdu4TmBYM4oj2fjRpMI6kD44dNy3HoJI9gFhBMMM&fref=nf An English-language summary can be read at https://www.romfea.news/the-decisions-of-the-holy-synod-of-ecumenical-patriarchate/. The latter states: During the meeting, it was decided to discharge Archbishop Ioannis [John] of Harioupolis from the Apostolic and Patriarchal Ecumenical Throne, personally and only to him, thereby relieving him of the responsibility of the Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox parishes of the Russian Tradition in Western Europe. As a consequence, Metropolitan Emmanuel of France is now responsible for parishes of the former Exarchate. The same is true of the rest of the former Exarchate parishes in other Western European countries, which fall under the responsibility of the respective Hierarchs of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in these areas. Furthermore, the Ecumenical Patriarchate has decided to appoint Archpriest Alexis Struve, University Professor, to replace the Head of St. Alexander Nevsky Holy Church in Paris. This discharge occurs approximately a week before the scheduled extraordinary assembly of the communities within the Archdiocese of the Russian Orthodox Church in Western Europe. The assembly had been called by Archbishop John and is to be held in Paris on September 7. It is reported that Archbishop John, who plans to chair the meeting, is strongly in favor of accepting the proposal of the Moscow Patriarchate in which certain concessions are promised if the Archdiocese comes under Moscow’s jurisdiction. The Office of the Archbishop (John) released today the following communique: http://www.exarchat.eu/spip.php?article2393 (official English translation). This communique may have been drafted before the discharge of the Archbishop had been communicated. The communique contains links to all of the documents that the Archbishop believes should be communicated to the assembly delegates. The communique also describes a meeting between the Archbishop and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew at Chambesy on August 17. My reading of the Archbishop’s communique is that the Ecumenical Patriarch showed little flexibility in retreating from the prior decision to dissolve the exarchate. On the other hand, a different version of the meeting has been posted at https://credo.press/226327/. The latter article contends: “Patriarch Bartholomew proposed returning under the omophorion of Constantinople. Moreover, he promised to maintain the status of a special independent structure for the archdiocese as part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. According to this proposal, the archbishopric will continue to be directly subordinate to the Phanar, bypassing the French Metropolis. Patriarch Bartholomew assured Archbishop John that the process of creating a new charter of the archbishopric is now underway – with broad rights, as they were before.” Although the author of this article is very opposed to Archbishop John, some credence may be given to the part quoted above as the Archbishop’s communique states that one of three options is “to set up a bilateral dialogue [with the Ecumenical Patriarchate]to re-examine the possibility of a new ecclesial structure for our Archdiocese.” The Archbishop’s communique makes it clear that the Ecumenical Patriarch asked that the assembly on September 7 be postponed. The apparent refusal of Archbishop John to postpone the assembly may be the reason for his discharge. The next week and a half should be very interesting. [Unfortunately, I will be on a short vacation beginning September 5 and will not be able to report on the events in an immediate fashion.] The Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate met on Friday, August 30. The following are the minutes of the meeting. http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/5492005.html One of the most interesting items is that Archbishop Amvrosij (Ermakov) has been appointed rector of the Sretensky Theological Seminary. Archbishop Amvrosij was rector of the St. Petersburg Theological Academy from 2008 to July 2018, at which time he was appointed rector of the Moscow Theological Schools. On July 9, 2019, the Holy Synod appointed him acting rector of the Sretensky Theological Seminary, while retaining his position as rector of the Moscow Theological Academy. http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/118363.html (summary of Amvrosij’s prior positions and responsibilities) Now, the Holy Synod has relieved Archbishop Amvrosij of his responsibilities as rector of the Moscow Theological Academy and made him rector (now longer “acting”) of the Sretensky Theological Seminary. (Journal Entry 104) The Holy Synod has now also made Archbishop Amvrosij the “Namestnik” (Наместник – the governor of an stauropegial monastery) of the Sretensky Stauropegial (one under the direct supervision of the Patriarch) Monastery. (Journal Entry 105) Thus, Archbishop Amvrosij now heads both the Sretensky Monastery and its Seminary – the same positions that Metropolitan Tikhon (Shevkunov) held prior to May 19, 2018. http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/60784.html (summary of Tikhon’s prior positions and responsibilities). Metropolitan Tikhon (Shevkunov) is, of course, the very popular bishop whom some believe might be the next Patriarch. He is also alleged to be the confessor of President Putin. Before he was transferred to Pskov by the Holy Synod, Sretensky was the base of operations of Tikhon and source of his influence. Now Sretensky will be headed by Archbishop Amvrosij. In my opinion, Archbishop Amvosij is a “star” in the education system of the Moscow Patriarchate. He was highly regarded as rector of the St. Petersburg Theological Academy and was very popular with his students. He is a strong and dynamic leader. It is very likely that his influence will be strongly felt at Sretensky. You may also recall that the Holy Synod on July 9 established a commission, headed by Archbishop Amvrosij, “to study the possibility of optimizing the educational process in these religious schools [the Moscow Academy and the Sretensky Seminary]and increasing the level of coordination of their scientific and pedagogical activities.” https://mospat.ru/ru/2019/07/09/news176092/ (Journal Entry 75) This resulted in protests in the media that Patriarch Kirill was engaging in a political move to eliminate the Sretensky Seminary. On July 23, Patriarch Kirill issued a document that simply specifies the specializations that each school will have. http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/5476288.html This seemed to allay the fears about the elimination of the Sretnesky Seminary. The appointment of Archbishop Amvrosij as rector of the Sretensky Seminary is further evidence that the Seminary will not disappear. In addition, Archbishop Amvrosij has a personal interest in preserving Sretensky as he was a monk there beginning in 2000 and was director of its famous choir. However, with a strong leader such as Archbishop Amvrosij, changes may occur, and Sretensky may be less identified with Metropolitan Tikhon in the future. In other news, Metropolitan Sergiy of Singapore (Moscow Patriarchate), head of the newly established Exarchate of Southeast Asia, has written a sharp “open letter” to Metropolitan Ambrosios of Korea (Ecumenical Patriarchate) concerning an interview given by the latter criticizing the Moscow Patriarchate. See https://theorthodoxworld.com/exclusive-open-letter-of-metropolitan-sergiy-of-singapore-to-metropolitan-ambrosios-of-korea/ (the open letter in English); https://theorthodoxworld.com/exclusive-how-the-moscow-patriarchate-tramples-on-church-canons-and-undermines-orthodox-unity-in-korea/ (the original interview in English). The Catholic delegation from Rome, headed by Father Hyacinthe Destivelle O.P., met with both Patriarch Kirill and Metropolitan Hilarion. The delegation is part of the annual exchange between the Moscow Patriarchate and the Vatican. https://mospat.ru/en/2019/08/30/news176954/ (meeting with Patriarch); https://mospat.ru/en/2019/08/29/news176947/ (meeting with Metropolitan Hilarion). The very important Serbian hierarch, Bishop Irinej of Backa, is visiting Russia with a group of pilgrims. On August 28, he, Metropolitan Hilarion, and Metropolitan Tikhon celebrated the Liturgy together at Pskov. https://mospat.ru/en/2019/08/29/news176934/ At that time, Metropolitan Hilarion delivered another strong attack against the Ecumenical Patriarchate. On August 29, the first meeting of the newly elected Ukrainian parliament was held. Metropolitan Onufry, Metropolitan Epifany, and other church leaders were present in the first row of the balcony. https://news.church.ua/2019/08/29/predstoyatel-vzyav-uchast-v-urochistomu-zasidanni-verxovnoji-radi/ The following shows the number of delegates that each faction has in the new parliament. https://rada.gov.ua/en/news/News/179734.html (English). Zelensky’s faction, the People’s Servant Party, has approximately 60 percent of the delegates. The Opposition Platform–For Life faction, sympathetic to Moscow, has approximately 10 percent of the delegates. Rumors continue that Pope Francis may accept the invitation of operatic soprano Svetlana Kasyan (her husband is Leonid Leonid Sevastianov, the head of a charitable fund established by Metropolitan Hilarion) to visit her family’s apartment in Moscow. The latest rumor relates to repairs being suddenly made by the city to the facade of the building in which the apartment is located. https://credo.press/226306/ With respect to these rumors, I remain a skeptic.

View Sign Obituary Send Flowers Cullen, Terrence Patrick "Terry" ALBANY Terrence Patrick Cullen "Terry" died peacefully in his sleep on August 26, 2019, after an extended illness. He was predeceased by his parents Edward and Elizabeth (Betty Powers); and his brother Michael. He is survived by his brothers, Joseph (Sherre) of Evanston, Ill., William (Roxanne) of Penfield, N.Y., and David (Vicky) of Horseheads, N.Y.; and his sister-in-law Jean Cullen of Elmira, N.Y. He was the beloved uncle of Adam, Brian (Kate), Ethan, Matthew, Jaimi, and Lindsey. He adored his great-nephew Graham. Terry is also survived by his former partner David Shetler; lifelong friends, Joseph Egnaczak and Michael McCann, and very close friends, Peter Mesh, Peter Slattery, Ron Gleason and Bill Capone; his goddaughter Marielle Celeste Brown and her mother Lisa Brown; and many dear friends. Terry was born in Elmira, N.Y. on April 6, 1955. He graduated from Thomas A. Edison High School in Elmira Heights, N.Y. in 1973. He was on the swim team and remained an avid swimmer his whole life. Terry competed in the Gay Games in Vancouver in 1990. Terry attended Corning Community College and the State University of New York at Alfred where he obtained a degree in nursing. He later went on to earn an M.P.A. from Syracuse University. Terry worked for the State of New York for nearly 40 years, first as a nurse and then in the Budget Department, where he retired as the deputy director of medicaid finance. Terry loved to travel and enjoyed his many adventures with family and friends, especially his trips abroad, to any beach anywhere, and to Wanakena in the beautiful Adirondacks. Terry played on the volleyball league in Syracuse for many years and continued to play after moving to Albany. He was also active in a tennis league in Albany, and he continued to play tennis, swim, and even learned to play pickle ball the last year of his life. Terry volunteered as a teen mentor for many years. After retiring, Terry volunteered at Albany Medical Center and Parsons Child & Family Center because he found great joy when working with children. Terry will be remembered for his kind heart, his thoughtful nature, and his gentle spirit. Terry was beloved by many. This was made clear by the outpouring of support shown by so many friends who helped him navigate his challenging final years. What a blessing and what a gift to him! A memorial service will be planned for a future date. In lieu of flowers, please consider making a gift to support Alzheimer's research, with the hope that fewer people will have to live with this dreadful disease.

No. 582 + B A R T H O L O M E W By God’s Mercy Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch To All the Plenitude of the Church Grace, Peace and Mercy from the Maker of All Creation Our Lord, God and Savior Jesus Christ Dearest brother Hierarchs and beloved children in the Lord, With the goodness and grace of the all-bountiful God, today marks the 30th anniversary since the Holy Great Church of Christ established the feast of Indiction and first day of the ecclesiastical year as “the day of environmental protection.” We did not only address our Orthodox faithful, nor again just Christian believer or even representatives of other religions, but also political leaders, environmentalists and other scientists, as well as intellectuals and all people of good will, seeking their contribution. The ecological activities of the Ecumenical Patriarchate served as the inspiration for theology to advance prominently the truth of Christian anthropology and cosmology, the Eucharistic worldview and treatment of creation, along with the spirit of Orthodox asceticism as the basis for understanding the reason for and response to the ecological crisis. The bibliography related to theological ecology or ecological theology is extensive and on the whole constitutes an admirable Orthodox witness before the major challenges of contemporary humanity and earthly life. Concern for the ecological crisis and for the global dimensions and consequences of sin – of this alienating internal “reversal of values” in humankind – brought to the surface the connection between ecological and social issues as well as for the need to address them jointly. Mobilizing forces for the protection of the integrity of creation and for social justice are interconnected and inseparable actions. The interest of the Ecumenical Patriarchate for the protection of creation did not arise as a reaction to or as a result of the contemporary ecological crisis. The latter was simply the motivation and occasion for the Church to express, develop, proclaim and promote its environmentally-friendly principles. The foundation of the Church’s undiminished concern for the natural environment lies in its ecclesiological identity and theology. Respect and care for creation are a dimension of our faith, the content of our life in the Church and as the Church. The very life of the Church is “an experienced ecology,” an applied respect and care for creation, and the source of its environmental activities. In essence, the interest of the Church for the protection of the environment is the extension of the Holy Eucharist in all dimensions of its relationship to the world. The liturgical life of the Church, the ascetic ethos, pastoral service and experience of the cross and resurrection by the faithful, the unquenchable desire for eternity: all of these comprise a communion of persons for which the natural reality cannot be reduced to an object or useful matter to meet the needs of an individual or humanity; by contrast, this reality is considered as an act, deed the handiwork of a personal God, who calls us to respect and protect it, thereby rendering us His “coworkers,” “stewards,” “guardians,” and “priests” of creation in order to cultivate a Eucharistic relationship with it. Care for the natural environment is not an added activity, but an essential expression of church life. It does not have a secular, but rather a purely ecclesiastical character. It is a “liturgical ministry.” All of the initiatives and activities of the Church are “applied ecclesiology.” In this sense, theological ecology does not merely refer to the development of an ecological awareness or the response to ecological problems on the basis of the principles of Christian anthropology and cosmology. On the contrary, it involves the renewal of the whole creation in Christ, just as this is realized and experienced in the Holy Eucharist, which is an image and foretaste of the eschatological fullness of the Divine Economy in the doxological wholeness and luminous splendor of the heavenly kingdom. Most honorable brothers and most precious children in the Lord, The ecological crisis reveals that our world comprises an integral whole, that our problems are global and shared. In order to meet these challenges, we require a multilayered mobilization, a common accord, direction and action. It is inconceivable for humankind to recognize the severity of the problem and yet continue to behave in oblivion. While in recent decades the dominant model of economic development in the context of globalization – highlighting the fetishism of financial markers and magnification of financial profit – has exacerbated ecological and economic problems, the notion still prevails widely that “there is no other alternative” and that not conforming to the rigid validity logic of the world’s economy will lead to unbridled social and financial situations. Thus, any alternative forms of development, along with the power of social solidarity and justice, are overlooked and undermined. For our part, however, we are obliged to assume greater measures for the application of the ecological and social consequences of our faith. It is extremely vital that our archdioceses and metropolises, as well as many of our parishes and sacred monasteries, have fostered initiatives and activities for the protection of the environment, but also various programs of ecological education. We should pay special attention to the Christian formation of our youth, so that it may function as an area of cultivation and development of an ecological ethos and solidarity. Childhood and adolescence are particularly susceptible life phases for ecological and social responsiveness. Aware of the urgency of environmental education, the Ecumenical Patriarchate devoted the Third in its series of international Halki Summits to the subject of “Theological Education and Ecological Awareness” (Istanbul, May 31st to June 4th, 2019) with a view to incorporating ecology and environmental awareness into programs and curricula of theological schools and seminaries. The solution to the great challenges of our world is unattainable without spiritual orientation. In conclusion, then, we wish all of you a favorable and blessed ecclesiastical year, filled with works pleasing to God. We invite the radiant children of the Mother Church throughout the world to pray for the integrity of creation, to be sustainable and charitable in every aspect of their lives, to strive for the protection of the natural environment, as well as the promotion of peace and justice. And we proclaim once more the truth that there can be no genuine progress, when the “very good” creation and the human person made in the image and likeness of God suffer. Finally, through the intercession of the first-among-the-saints Theotokos Pammakaristos, we invoke upon you the life-giving grace and boundless mercy of the Creator and Provider of all.

No. 3: Brotherhood of St. Symeon the New Theologian, Miramar, FL The “Historic Church” is always an “imperfect Church,” despite her inherent sanctity. Every student of Church History knows it but well. The “Golden Age” of the Church – the age of Chrysostom and the Cappadocians – was an age of schisms, rifts, treason and suspicions. Did not St. Gregory of Nazianzus suggest that apparently Christ was asleep on the boat tossed by storms? Did not St. Basil describe the story of his time as that of an eclipse, when it was almost impossible in the darkness – to tell foes from friends? Was not St. John Chrysostom betrayed by his fellow-bishops and was to die as a “bloodless martyr”? And yet, it was, no doubt, a golden age! On the other hand, Christian preaching had always been an offense, already in the times of St. Paul. Yet, St. Paul did not think that it was permissible to “adjust” his preaching to the “capacity” of those to whom it had to be addressed. He did not hesitate “to offend” them. Why should we, in our own time, be shy at this point, and be so concerned with the “changing times”? There is no crisis of traditional theology, but there is a profound crisis of belief, of faith. Those, who are unable and unwilling to believe with the Church, still want to be counted as Christians. Then they face an alternative: disregard all that they do not find valid (what the majority of the actual membership in our Church is doing, without “theology”, dogmas, etc.) or call for a formal retraction of what they perceive as “traditional”, “obsolete”, “ancient”, “Hellenic.” They have lost faith, and for that reason, they feel that they need to change theology. Indeed, bad or negligent teaching in our Church has been responsible for that defection or ignorance. I mean, the teaching might have been deficient, but true theology is, nevertheless, true and valid. Reinterpretation may be needed, but not an adjustment. Let those who are still feeling with the Church (sentire cum ecclesia), thank God for His help and blessing, because faith is somehow always a gift of God, in Spiritu Sancto. What we are missing now is a theology well-presented. Unfortunately, one begins very often not with “the Faith as once delivered unto the Saints,” but with the alleged “Modern Mind,” which is, in fact, still in flux. A Protestant friend of mine rightly suggested that the “Modern Man” has not yet made up his mind. Rather, he is simply a person with modern moods and whims.

The press release concerning the results of the meeting was posted today (Saturday). https://www.facebook.com/ecumenicalpatriarchate/?__tn__=kCH-R&eid=ARCT1A3O6dAskvFf0ErJbFzhmpS-zkbxs6v_KkfWrsdlDqjDVGWmFku5vJ8J-roM5_ttDWTqYUX0B0vx&hc_ref=ARTsNzwPjolkEHRPNLm-QSwZq98tdu4TmBYM4oj2fjRpMI6kD44dNy3HoJI9gFhBMMM&fref=nf An English-language summary can be read at https://www.romfea.news/the-decisions-of-the-holy-synod-of-ecumenical-patriarchate/. The latter states: During the meeting, it was decided to discharge Archbishop Ioannis [John] of Harioupolis from the Apostolic and Patriarchal Ecumenical Throne, personally and only to him, thereby relieving him of the responsibility of the Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox parishes of the Russian Tradition in Western Europe. As a consequence, Metropolitan Emmanuel of France is now responsible for parishes of the former Exarchate. The same is true of the rest of the former Exarchate parishes in other Western European countries, which fall under the responsibility of the respective Hierarchs of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in these areas. Furthermore, the Ecumenical Patriarchate has decided to appoint Archpriest Alexis Struve, University Professor, to replace the Head of St. Alexander Nevsky Holy Church in Paris. This discharge occurs approximately a week before the scheduled extraordinary assembly of the communities within the Archdiocese of the Russian Orthodox Church in Western Europe. The assembly had been called by Archbishop John and is to be held in Paris on September 7. It is reported that Archbishop John, who plans to chair the meeting, is strongly in favor of accepting the proposal of the Moscow Patriarchate in which certain concessions are promised if the Archdiocese comes under Moscow’s jurisdiction. The Office of the Archbishop (John) released today the following communique: http://www.exarchat.eu/spip.php?article2393 (official English translation). This communique may have been drafted before the discharge of the Archbishop had been communicated. The communique contains links to all of the documents that the Archbishop believes should be communicated to the assembly delegates. The communique also describes a meeting between the Archbishop and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew at Chambesy on August 17. My reading of the Archbishop’s communique is that the Ecumenical Patriarch showed little flexibility in retreating from the prior decision to dissolve the exarchate. On the other hand, a different version of the meeting has been posted at https://credo.press/226327/. The latter article contends: “Patriarch Bartholomew proposed returning under the omophorion of Constantinople. Moreover, he promised to maintain the status of a special independent structure for the archdiocese as part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. According to this proposal, the archbishopric will continue to be directly subordinate to the Phanar, bypassing the French Metropolis. Patriarch Bartholomew assured Archbishop John that the process of creating a new charter of the archbishopric is now underway – with broad rights, as they were before.” Although the author of this article is very opposed to Archbishop John, some credence may be given to the part quoted above as the Archbishop’s communique states that one of three options is “to set up a bilateral dialogue [with the Ecumenical Patriarchate]to re-examine the possibility of a new ecclesial structure for our Archdiocese.” The Archbishop’s communique makes it clear that the Ecumenical Patriarch asked that the assembly on September 7 be postponed. The apparent refusal of Archbishop John to postpone the assembly may be the reason for his discharge. The next week and a half should be very interesting. [Unfortunately, I will be on a short vacation beginning September 5 and will not be able to report on the events in an immediate fashion.] The Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate met on Friday, August 30. The following are the minutes of the meeting. http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/5492005.html One of the most interesting items is that Archbishop Amvrosij (Ermakov) has been appointed rector of the Sretensky Theological Seminary. Archbishop Amvrosij was rector of the St. Petersburg Theological Academy from 2008 to July 2018, at which time he was appointed rector of the Moscow Theological Schools. On July 9, 2019, the Holy Synod appointed him acting rector of the Sretensky Theological Seminary, while retaining his position as rector of the Moscow Theological Academy. http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/118363.html (summary of Amvrosij’s prior positions and responsibilities) Now, the Holy Synod has relieved Archbishop Amvrosij of his responsibilities as rector of the Moscow Theological Academy and made him rector (now longer “acting”) of the Sretensky Theological Seminary. (Journal Entry 104) The Holy Synod has now also made Archbishop Amvrosij the “Namestnik” (Наместник – the governor of an stauropegial monastery) of the Sretensky Stauropegial (one under the direct supervision of the Patriarch) Monastery. (Journal Entry 105) Thus, Archbishop Amvrosij now heads both the Sretensky Monastery and its Seminary – the same positions that Metropolitan Tikhon (Shevkunov) held prior to May 19, 2018. http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/60784.html (summary of Tikhon’s prior positions and responsibilities). Metropolitan Tikhon (Shevkunov) is, of course, the very popular bishop whom some believe might be the next Patriarch. He is also alleged to be the confessor of President Putin. Before he was transferred to Pskov by the Holy Synod, Sretensky was the base of operations of Tikhon and source of his influence. Now Sretensky will be headed by Archbishop Amvrosij. In my opinion, Archbishop Amvosij is a “star” in the education system of the Moscow Patriarchate. He was highly regarded as rector of the St. Petersburg Theological Academy and was very popular with his students. He is a strong and dynamic leader. It is very likely that his influence will be strongly felt at Sretensky. You may also recall that the Holy Synod on July 9 established a commission, headed by Archbishop Amvrosij, “to study the possibility of optimizing the educational process in these religious schools [the Moscow Academy and the Sretensky Seminary]and increasing the level of coordination of their scientific and pedagogical activities.” https://mospat.ru/ru/2019/07/09/news176092/ (Journal Entry 75) This resulted in protests in the media that Patriarch Kirill was engaging in a political move to eliminate the Sretensky Seminary. On July 23, Patriarch Kirill issued a document that simply specifies the specializations that each school will have. http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/5476288.html This seemed to allay the fears about the elimination of the Sretnesky Seminary. The appointment of Archbishop Amvrosij as rector of the Sretensky Seminary is further evidence that the Seminary will not disappear. In addition, Archbishop Amvrosij has a personal interest in preserving Sretensky as he was a monk there beginning in 2000 and was director of its famous choir. However, with a strong leader such as Archbishop Amvrosij, changes may occur, and Sretensky may be less identified with Metropolitan Tikhon in the future. In other news, Metropolitan Sergiy of Singapore (Moscow Patriarchate), head of the newly established Exarchate of Southeast Asia, has written a sharp “open letter” to Metropolitan Ambrosios of Korea (Ecumenical Patriarchate) concerning an interview given by the latter criticizing the Moscow Patriarchate. See https://theorthodoxworld.com/exclusive-open-letter-of-metropolitan-sergiy-of-singapore-to-metropolitan-ambrosios-of-korea/ (the open letter in English); https://theorthodoxworld.com/exclusive-how-the-moscow-patriarchate-tramples-on-church-canons-and-undermines-orthodox-unity-in-korea/ (the original interview in English). The Catholic delegation from Rome, headed by Father Hyacinthe Destivelle O.P., met with both Patriarch Kirill and Metropolitan Hilarion. The delegation is part of the annual exchange between the Moscow Patriarchate and the Vatican. https://mospat.ru/en/2019/08/30/news176954/ (meeting with Patriarch); https://mospat.ru/en/2019/08/29/news176947/ (meeting with Metropolitan Hilarion). The very important Serbian hierarch, Bishop Irinej of Backa, is visiting Russia with a group of pilgrims. On August 28, he, Metropolitan Hilarion, and Metropolitan Tikhon celebrated the Liturgy together at Pskov. https://mospat.ru/en/2019/08/29/news176934/ At that time, Metropolitan Hilarion delivered another strong attack against the Ecumenical Patriarchate. On August 29, the first meeting of the newly elected Ukrainian parliament was held. Metropolitan Onufry, Metropolitan Epifany, and other church leaders were present in the first row of the balcony. https://news.church.ua/2019/08/29/predstoyatel-vzyav-uchast-v-urochistomu-zasidanni-verxovnoji-radi/ The following shows the number of delegates that each faction has in the new parliament. https://rada.gov.ua/en/news/News/179734.html (English). Zelensky’s faction, the People’s Servant Party, has approximately 60 percent of the delegates. The Opposition Platform–For Life faction, sympathetic to Moscow, has approximately 10 percent of the delegates. Rumors continue that Pope Francis may accept the invitation of operatic soprano Svetlana Kasyan (her husband is Leonid Leonid Sevastianov, the head of a charitable fund established by Metropolitan Hilarion) to visit her family’s apartment in Moscow. The latest rumor relates to repairs being suddenly made by the city to the facade of the building in which the apartment is located. https://credo.press/226306/ With respect to these rumors, I remain a skeptic.

Similar phrases were also in the letter of Archbishop Anastasius, primate of the Albanian Church, and in the letter of the Synod of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus. But they do not concern the recognition of the Church itself,” Fr. Nikolai explained. The Greek Church understands what is schism and what isn’t, Fr. Nikolai said. However, they are under pressure and want to avoid a direct confrontation with Constantinople. “But they cannot change the truth and say that what is obviously wrong is right; they cannot call black white.” Vladimir Legoida, the head of the Moscow Patriarchate’s Synodal Department for Relations with Society and the Media, also spoke of the pressure on the Greek Church: “How the Greek Church discusses the question of the schismatic OCU demonstrates the unprecedented severity of the problem and also of the pressure that is being exerted.” The Greek Church offered Constantinople “a spoonful of honey” with its statement about the Patriarchate’s right to grant autocephaly, though at the same time, the statement is balanced and generally well received, Fr. Nikolai noted. “We understand the whole situation the Greek Church has found itself in, and we see that it does not want to be responsible for the splitting of the Orthodox world. Because any other Church that joins this decision of Constantinople, will be the first, in fact, in the division of the Orthodox world into two parts: Those who will recognize the OCU, and those who will not,” the speaker said. He also noted that there are no analogous situations in Church history in which a minority schismatic group was granted autocephaly and raised above the group that all Churches recognized as canonical. “The Russian Orthodox Church has always testified that the most important factor in this discussion should be concern for the Orthodox Ukrainians, the children of the canonical Church, who as a result of the Phanar’s intervention became a majority persecuted by the radicals,” Legoida also wrote. “Any support for the OCU by the Local Churches can only lead to further division in Ukrainian society, the deepening of the schism, and the escalation of hatred,” the Russian Church representative said.

View Sign Obituary Send Flowers Cullen, Terrence Patrick "Terry" ALBANY Terrence Patrick Cullen "Terry" died peacefully in his sleep on August 26, 2019, after an extended illness. He was predeceased by his parents Edward and Elizabeth (Betty Powers); and his brother Michael. He is survived by his brothers, Joseph (Sherre) of Evanston, Ill., William (Roxanne) of Penfield, N.Y., and David (Vicky) of Horseheads, N.Y.; and his sister-in-law Jean Cullen of Elmira, N.Y. He was the beloved uncle of Adam, Brian (Kate), Ethan, Matthew, Jaimi, and Lindsey. He adored his great-nephew Graham. Terry is also survived by his former partner David Shetler; lifelong friends, Joseph Egnaczak and Michael McCann, and very close friends, Peter Mesh, Peter Slattery, Ron Gleason and Bill Capone; his goddaughter Marielle Celeste Brown and her mother Lisa Brown; and many dear friends. Terry was born in Elmira, N.Y. on April 6, 1955. He graduated from Thomas A. Edison High School in Elmira Heights, N.Y. in 1973. He was on the swim team and remained an avid swimmer his whole life. Terry competed in the Gay Games in Vancouver in 1990. Terry attended Corning Community College and the State University of New York at Alfred where he obtained a degree in nursing. He later went on to earn an M.P.A. from Syracuse University. Terry worked for the State of New York for nearly 40 years, first as a nurse and then in the Budget Department, where he retired as the deputy director of medicaid finance. Terry loved to travel and enjoyed his many adventures with family and friends, especially his trips abroad, to any beach anywhere, and to Wanakena in the beautiful Adirondacks. Terry played on the volleyball league in Syracuse for many years and continued to play after moving to Albany. He was also active in a tennis league in Albany, and he continued to play tennis, swim, and even learned to play pickle ball the last year of his life. Terry volunteered as a teen mentor for many years. After retiring, Terry volunteered at Albany Medical Center and Parsons Child & Family Center because he found great joy when working with children. Terry will be remembered for his kind heart, his thoughtful nature, and his gentle spirit. Terry was beloved by many. This was made clear by the outpouring of support shown by so many friends who helped him navigate his challenging final years. What a blessing and what a gift to him!
